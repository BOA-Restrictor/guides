# Guides

Guides is a public repo for storing, among other things, public configuration files for linters.

### Style guide configurations

[Ruby](/style/ruby/.rubocop.yml)
[JavaScript](https://github.com/BetterOfficeApps/eslint-config-lendesk)

### How to request a style guide configuration update

Bad reasons for requesting a change:

1. To avoid fixing existing style guide violations
2. Personal preference

If you have identified a rule which should not use the default configuration please:

1. Create a pull-request against the appropriate configuration file
2. Give the team at least one week to review / discuss the requested change
3. Merge or close the pull-request based on team feedback
